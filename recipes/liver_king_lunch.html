    <h3>The King's Superfood</h3>
    <p>It's not gross. This raw assortment of pasture-raised cow parts will act like rocket fuel to your health. You will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Ribeye</li>
      <li>4-8oz. Raw beef liver</li>
      <li>2-3 Raw marrow bones</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add a pinch of salt as desired. Feel free to sear both faces of the ribeye (cooking well-done is strictly prohibited!). If the liver is too much to stomach on its own, dice into bite-sized chunks and drizzle with maple syrup, or take chunks down like pills with a drink. Marrow best eaten raw, but can also be baked at 425 degrees to soften, then spread on whole-grain toast.</p>
